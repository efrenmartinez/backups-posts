# My study plan for 2021

2020 is over. And for many, including myself, it has been quite a different year.

A year where I learned to work remotely, to follow up my tasks by video calls, to have a space in my house to work. In short, we had to adapt to the situation.

Before starting 2021 I have written a small list of things that I want to learn with the intention of continuing to improve as a developer, try to divide into the following categories:

- **Main goal**
- **Back to basics**
- **Out of my comfort zone**
- **Technologies that promise a lot**
- **Technologies that are not technologies, but I want to learn**

# Main goal

My main goal for this year 2021 is to learn English.

An objective that I did not give importance to before and for which I have lost very good job opportunities üòï.

For this I will study the Platzi School of English. üëåüèª

I will spend more time with my coaches to practice.

# Back to basics

I have more than 4 years programming JavaScript in its different flavors and colors. üçßüçß

- JavaScript.
- JQuery.
- Angular v2.
- VueJS.

Still I find it productive to go back to basics. The fundamentals that I want to learn again.üòé

1. Event loop.
2. Asynchronism.
3. Promises.
4. API¬¥s DOM.

For that I want to finish the School of JavaScript (now yes üòÜ).

In addition to JavaScript, I want to review my own web development concepts such as:

1. Responsive Design.
2. CSS Grid Layout.
3. Animations.

# Out of my comfort zone

Up to this point all of the above have been Front-End themes, in an effort to get out of my comfort zone I want to venture a little more to Back-End:

1. Docker and Docker Compose.
2. PHP specifically Lavavel.
3. Wordpress.
4. Serverless.

# Technologies that promise a lot

Technologies that I have been following in recent months and they promise a lot.

1. VueJS v3.
2. NextJS / React JS.
3. GraphQL.
4. Strapi.
5. Tailwind CSS.
6. Ionic / React Native.

# Technologies that are not technologies, but I want to learn

Topics that I am interested in learning to improve my professional profile:

1. How to write good content.
2. How to write good documentation.

## A busy year ahead

On paper you can see that there is a lot to learn but being honest I am not in a hurry to complete it because I can always move the topics to the year 2021, what matters is never stop learning.
